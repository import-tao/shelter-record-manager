# List of Things to Do
The app is split into two so to speak. There is the main part which anyone can access and then the app itself (within the catalog folder) which is where the actual management of the shelter will happen.
This is why there is two template folders and there are two 'base.html' templates.

The base.html templates will be pulled through to the other templates.

## To do

### Backend

- Create Models
- Expand url routing
- Create views

### Frontend

- Complete design of base.html files needed (possibly use bootstrap)
- Creation of different pages

## Done

- Set up email
- Use environment variables for sensitive info
