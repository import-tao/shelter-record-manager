# List of Things to Do

The app is split into two so to speak. There is the main part which anyone can access and then the app itself (within the catalog folder) which is where the actual management of the shelter will happen.
This is why there is two template folders and there are two 'base.html' templates.

The base.html templates will be pulled through to the other templates.

## To do

### Backend

- Expand url routing
- Create views
- Build testing
- Create Rest API
- Allow import/export of data
- Improve user registration so can determine who can create an account
- Possibly look at introducing a subdomain depending on shelter.
  - if doing this possibly tailor users to specific domains etc.

### Frontend

- Complete design of base.html files needed (possibly use bootstrap or CSS grid)
- Creation of different pages

### Done

- Set up email
- Use environment variables for sensitive info
- Create Models
